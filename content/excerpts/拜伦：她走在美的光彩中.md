她走在美的光彩中，如夜晚  
皎洁无云而且繁星漫天  
明与暗的最美妙的色泽  
在她的仪容和秋波里呈现  
耀目的白日只嫌光线过强  
它比那光亮柔和且幽暗  
增一分影，减一线光  
就会损害这难言的美……

## She walks in beauty

She walks in beauty, like the night  
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;  
And all that’s best of dark and bright  
Meet in her aspect and her eyes:  
Thus mellow’d to that tender light  
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.  
One shade the more, one ray the less,  
Had half impair’d the nameless grace...
