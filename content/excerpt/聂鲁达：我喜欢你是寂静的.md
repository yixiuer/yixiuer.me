我喜欢你是寂静的，仿佛你消失了一样。  
你从远处聆听我，我的声音却无法触及你。  
好像你的双眼已经飞离远去，  
如同一个吻，封缄了你的嘴。  
如同所有的事物充满了我的灵魂，  
你从所有的事物中浮现，充满了我的灵魂。  
你像我灵魂，一只梦的蝴蝶，  
你如同忧郁这个字。

我喜欢你是寂静的，好像你已远去。  
你听起来像在悲叹，一只如鸽悲鸣的蝴蝶。  
你从远处听见我，我的声音无法企及你。  
让我在你的沉默中安静无声。  
并且让我借你的沉默与你说话，  
你的沉默明亮如灯，简单如指环。  
你就像黑夜，拥有寂静与群星。  
你的沉默就是星星的沉默，遥远而明亮。

我喜欢你是寂静的，仿佛你消失了一样，  
遥远且哀伤，仿佛你已经死了。  
彼时，一个字，一个微笑，已经足够。  
而我会觉得幸福，因那不是真的而觉得幸福。[^1]

## I Like For You To Be Still

I like for you to be still  
It is as though you are absent  
And you hear me from far away  
And my voice does not touch you  
It seems as though your eyes had flown away  
And it seems that a kiss had sealed your mouth  
As all things are filled with my soul  
You emerge from the things  
Filled with my soul  
You are like my soul  
A butterfly of dream  
And you are like the word: Melancholy

I like for you to be still  
And you seem far away  
It sounds as though you are lamenting  
A butterfly cooing like a dove  
And you hear me from far away  
And my voice does not reach you  
Let me come to be still in your silence  
And let me talk to you with your silence  
That is bright as a lamp  
Simple, as a ring  
You are like the night  
With its stillness and constellations  
Your silence is that of a star  
As remote and candid

I like for you to be still  
It is as though you are absent  
Distant and full of sorrow  
So you would’ve died  
One word then, One smile is enough  
And I’m happy;  
Happy that it’s not true
